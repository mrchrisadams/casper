<h1>Ghost</h1>

<p>A gem that allows you to create, list, and modify local hostnames
with ease in linux and OS (more to come)...</p>

<h1>Requirements</h1>

<p>Unix-based OS (for now)</p>

<h1>Intended Usage</h1>

<p>This gem is designed primarily for web developers who need to add
and modify hostnames to their system for virtual hosts on their
local/remote web server. However, it could be of use to other people
who would otherwise modify their <code>/etc/hosts</code> file manually and
flush the cache.</p>

<h2>Command</h2>

<pre><code>$ ghost add mydevsite.local
  [Adding] mydevsite.local -&gt; 127.0.0.1

$ ghost add staging-server.local 67.207.136.164
  [Adding] staging-server.local -&gt; 67.207.136.164

$ ghost list
